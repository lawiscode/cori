CORI 

Criminal Offender Record Information

We are building a web application for CORI record sealing.

Attorneys at the Greater Boston Legal Services and Suffolk Law School clinical programs described a need for a free guide/do-it-yourself online application for people with criminal records in MA to seal their criminal history records. GBLS provides a wide range of legal services in civil matters at no cost to people who qualify. And Suffolk Law school has a program where students are learning to use innovations in technology to speed up, make more efficient, and so reduce the cost of legal representation so that lower income people can benefit from access to the legal system just as monied individuals do.  

A record of criminal cases is an issue that affects poor people, people with low literacy/education levels, and people of color disprportionately from the rest of the population. Many employers, landlords, and some educational training programs in certain trades conduct criminal background checks before allowing people access.  So that many individuals with long past involvement with the criminal justice system, or individuals who may have had charges against them which were subsequently found to have no validity, dismissed etc. continue to suffer the consequences and stigma of a criminal record.
